# Mini-Zoo
Just a simple program
with four choices
[1] add animals = ok
[2] create cage = ok
[3] show animals = ok
[4] transfer animals = no function yet.


my main problem is 
on how to add multiple values on different keys in dictionary
for example. after i created a cage no. 100, and i added animals on it. its successful theres no problem with this after i
press the show animals.
so *here is my problem, once i created a new cage no. 200, and i added animals on it, all the animals that i added to the cage no.
100 will be added also to the newly created cage no. 200.

... this kind of process i already did it in java console. so im just making a new version using python language
