# Mini-Zoo
Just a simple program
with four choices
[1] add animals
[2] create cage
[3] show animals
[4] transfer animals = no function yet.


my main problem is for example i created a cage no. 100 and i added 5 animals on it. everything is fine once
you press the number for the show animals. all the animals there in a single key.
and *here is my main problem if i added a new cage like cage no. 200 and i added only one animal for that key,
all the animals that i added to the first cage will be added also to the newly created cage.?
